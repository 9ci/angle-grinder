REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is an architectural style that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.

Grails provides several nice features to implement REST.

First is resource anotaion `@Resource`, that creates controller with basic CRUD operations for you. So when you have next
domain class
```
@Resource(uri='/orgs', formats=['xml', 'json'])
class Org {
	String name
}
```
and no implemented controllers, `http://localhost:8080/orgs` will return you a list of all your orgs:
```
<list>
	<org id="1">
		<name>Org_18</name>
	</org>
	<org id="2">
		<name>Org_14</name>
	</org>
</list>
```
__Note __ It returns xml because it is on the first place for `formats=['xml', 'json']` property, if one changes
to `formats=['json', 'xml']` then JSON will be returned by default. But it accept both format
